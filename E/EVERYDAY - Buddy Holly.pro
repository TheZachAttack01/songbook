TIP:  For the intro you'll need to hit the 1st string/5th fret with your pinky while holding (D) like in the diagram.  This is a stretch for many.  If you can't comfortably reach it from a conventional (D) try this:  Use your index finger to barre the 3 treble strings of the 2nd fret as close to the 2nd fret bar as you can and still get a nice clear sound.  Now use your middle finger to arch up and over the 1st string to the 2nd string/3rd fret.  This should free up enough space to reach the 5th fret with your pinky.  Strum twice without the pinky in place and then tap that 1st string with your pinky.  It's not 2 beats and a pause, it's three quick beats.  Do this 4 times and at the end of the 4th time keep the pinky on the 1st string and start the song through "everyday" until you get to the first (Em).

TIP:  That strange (DaddA) chord comes again at the outro but it's coming off a (D) and for some reason it's easier to hit if you're already playing a (D).  It's just a three-note twinkle with (D) so strum the (DaddA) and then lift and clip the 1st string and finish on the 2nd string.  If transposing, play the root chord of the transposed (DaddA) adding the 5th note as necessary.

TIP:  To play the (Emsus4) just lift off the bottom finger (youâ€™ll already be playing (A7).
