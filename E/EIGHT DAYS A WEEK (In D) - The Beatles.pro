(Also in G which doesn't have the (Bm) and is probably easier to play.)

TIP:  If transposing, play the root chord of the transposed (DaddA) adding the 5th note as necessary.  Untransposed (DaddA) in the first chord of the intro/outro in which you form a regular (D) and extend your pinky over to the 1st string of the 5th fret.

TIP:  The (E7) and (E) are pretty much interchangeable - whichever sounds better to you.

TIP:  In the chorus the |Bm| in brackets means to strum once at this point and hold the sustain through the rest of the line with a double strike of (Bm) at the end (actually drums).
