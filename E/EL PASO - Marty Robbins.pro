[INTRO:]     [D]     [Em]       [A]     [A7]       [D]     [D4][-][D]


Out in the West Texas [Em]town of El Paso, [A]I  fell in love with a [A7]Mexican [D]girl. [D4][-][D]  
Night time would find me in [Em]Rosa's cantina, [A]music would play and [A7]Felina would [D]whirl. [D4][-][D]  
Blacker than night were the [Em]eyes of Felina, [A]wicked and evil while [A7]casting a [D] spell. [D4][-][D]  
My love was deep for this [Em]Mexican maiden, [A]I  was in love, but in [A7]vain I could [D]tell. [D4][-][D]


[G]One night a wild young cowboy came in, wild as the West Texas [D]win - in- [D7]nd.
Dashing and [D]daring a drink he was sharing with wicked Felina the [D7]girl that I [G]loved.  


So in [A]an[A7]ger I [D]challenged his right for the [Em]love of this maiden.   [A]Down went his hand for the [A7]gun that he [D]wore. [D4][-][D]  
My challenge was answered in [Em]less than a heart-beat, the [A]handsome young stranger lay [A7]dead on the [D]floor. [D4][-][D]    
Just for a moment I [Em]stood there in silence, [A]shocked by the foul evil [A7]deed I had [D]done. [D4][-][D]
Many thoughts raced through my [Em]mind as I stood there, [A]I  had but one chance and [A7]that was to [D]run. [D4][-][D]


[G]Out through the back door of Rosa's I ran.   Out where the horses were [D]ti -i- [D7]ied.
I caught a [D]good one it looked like it could run.   Up on its back and a[D7]way I did [G]ride.  


Just as [A]fast [A7]as I [D]could from the West Texas [Em]town of El Paso, [A]out to the badlands of [A7]New Mexi[D]co. [D4][-][D]  
Back in El Paso my [Em]life would be worthless.   [A]Everything's gone in life [A7]nothing is [D]left. [D4][-][D]  
It's been so long since I've [Em]seen the young maiden.   [A]My love is stronger than [A7]my fear of [D]death. [D4][-][D]


[G]I saddled up and away I did go.   Riding alone in the [D]dar - ar-[D7]ark.
Maybe to[D]morrow a bullet may find me.   Tonight nothing's worse than this [D7]pain in my [G]heart.  


And at [A]last [A7]here I [D]am on the hill over [Em]looking El Paso.   [A]I  can see Rosa's Can[A7]tina be[D]low. [D4][-][D]   
My love is strong and it [Em]pushes me onward, [A]down off the hill to Fe[A7]lina I [D]go. [D4][-][D]  
Off to my right I see [Em]five mounted cowboys, [A]off to my left ride a [A7]dozen or [D]more. [D4][-][D]   
Shouting and shooting I [Em]can't let them catch me.   [A]I  have to make it to [A7]Rosa's back [D]door. [D4][-][D]


[G]Something is dreadfully wrong for I feel, a deep burning pain in my [D]si -i- [D7]ide. 
Though I am [D]trying to stay in the saddle, I'm getting weary un[D7]able to [G]ride.  


But my [A]love [A7]for Fe[D]lina is strong and I [Em]rise where I've fallen, [A]though I am weary I [A7]can't stop to [D]rest. [D4][-][D] 
I see the white puff of [Em]smoke from the rifle, [A]I  feel the bullet go [A7]deep in my [D]chest. [D4][-][D]  
From out of nowhere Fe[Em]lina has found me, [A]kissing my cheek as she [A7]kneels by my [D]side. [D4][-][D]
Cradled by two loving [Em]arms that I'll die for, [A]one little kiss and Fe[A7]lina . . . gooood [D]byyyye.
