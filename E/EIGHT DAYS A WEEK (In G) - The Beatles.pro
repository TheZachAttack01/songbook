TIP:  If transposing play the root chord of the transposed (CaddG) adding the 5th note as necessary.  For the first (CaddG) chord of the intro/outro form a regular (C) but use your pinky to cover the bottom string of the 3rd fret, note (g).

TIP:  The (D7) and (D) are pretty much interchangeable--whichever sounds better to you.

TIP:  In the chorus the | Am | in brackets means to strum once at this point and hold the sustain through the rest of the line with a double strike of (Am) at the end (actually drums).
