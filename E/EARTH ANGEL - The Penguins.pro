TIP:  If transposing, play the root chord of the transposed (Gadd) adding the 5th note as necessary.

TIP:  The chord cadence is important.  It’s hard to explain but kind of goes 1 (pause) 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 (pause) 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 (pause) 1 - 2 - 3 - 4, and the sequence pretty much repeats for the whole song.  Try it on the intro to get the hang of it. 

TIP:  The voicing in the second bridge is differently than the first.  Follow the pacing and chord changes as shown.  The outro is a vocal climb from "wi-ith you-ou" with the last three "you"s a vocal walk back down.
