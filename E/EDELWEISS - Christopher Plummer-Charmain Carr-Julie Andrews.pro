TIP:  There are two versions on the Sound of Music soundtrack.  The duet with The Captain (Plummer) and Lisle (Carr) has all the lyrics shown here.  The duet with The Captain (Plummer) and Maria (Andrews) skips the first line after "my homeland forever" and begins again with "Small and white" but otherwise is identical.

TIP:  In the intro play the chord and pick the note.  Untransposed it's the open 4th string (d).  Remember to come off the (C) to open the 4th string.  After the (Gadd) the string is plucked twice and for the latter three chords it's struck three times with just a brief hesitation after the first two plucks.

TIP:  There's a little outro in which you're holding the final chord of the song.  Still holding the chord, pluck the notes.  Untransposed the ending chord is a (G) and the notes are 5th string, 4th string, and then the bottom three strings together.
