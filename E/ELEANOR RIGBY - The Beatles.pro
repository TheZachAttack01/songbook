TIP:  The (Em)s at the end of the intro, and later in the bridge, are the quick violin draws.

TIP:  Note there are two variations on the (Em7).  The first is played in the verse and has been renamed (Em/D) and is played with the pinky on note <d>.  The other (Em7) leads off the chorus and is played with one finger on note <b> 5th string/2nd fret.

TIP:  The verse is a walkdown within the (Em).  You’ll already be at (Em) so from there you hold the (Em) and add your pinky to the 2nd string/3rd fret for the (Em/D), then slide down to the 2nd fret for (Em6), and lift off to get back to (Em). 

TIP:  Note in the verse, the last word is a two-count.  Hold the (C) through the beginning of the word and slide smoothly to the (Em) on second count.  E.g. “(C) Who is it for- (Em) or?”

TIP:  The coda is a set of single violin strums that begins on the final word “belong”.  Instead of an (Em) start the series with an |Em/G| in which you play (Em) but add your pinky to the 1st string/3rd fret note <g>, lift off for a strum |Em|, then an |Asus4| which is (A) with your bottom finger slid up one fret, then lift off for the |Esus4|, and finish with a |G| but don’t hit the top two strings.  Hardest part is the move from (Em) to (Asus4).  Just drop the top two fingers down one string-set and cover the <d> with your pinky.
