TIP:  Unfortunately, Johnny felt it necessary to sharp the second half of the song.  I'm not having any of it and didn't sharp the chords.  You'll have to slap a capo on the 1st fret to continue playing along with Burl.

TIP:  The first part of the intro is the ding-dong-ding.  The second two triad of chords in the intro is the same as ". . . say hello to friends you know and everyone you meet."
