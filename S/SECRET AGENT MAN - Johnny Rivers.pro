TIP:  To emulate Johnny's electric guitar riff you play a simple one-note slide from (Em) to (C) to (A7/C) and back to (C).  The (A7/C) chord is (C) with the index finger slid up from the 1st fret to the 2nd fret (same string).

TIP:  Also note the riff is played at the end of the chorus.  The chorus ends in an (Em) which forms the first chord of the riff, so you play it immediately upon reaching "name".
