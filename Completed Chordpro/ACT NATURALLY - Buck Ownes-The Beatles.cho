They'rrrrrre gonna put me in the [C]movies.   [G]They're gonna make a big star out of [D]me.
We'll [G]make a film about a man that's sad and [C]lonely.   And [D7]all I gotta do is, act natural[G]ly.

Well I'll [D]bet you, I'm gonna be a [G]big star.   Might [D]win an Oscar, you can never [G]tell.
The [D]movie's gonna make me a [G]big star.   'Cause [A]I can play the [A7]part so [D]well.[D7]

Well I [G]hope you'll come and see me in the [C]movies.   [G]Then I'll know that you will plainly [D]see,
The [G]biggest fool that ever hit the [C]big time.   And [D7]all I gotta do is, act natural[G]ly.

We'll make the scene about a man that's sad and [C]lonely.  And [G]beggin' down upon his bended [D]knee.
I'll [G]play the part, but I won't need re[C]hearsing.  [D7]All I have to do is, act natural[G]ly.

Well I'll [D]bet you, I'm gonna be a [G]big star.   Might [D]win an Oscar, you can never [G]tell.
The [D]movie's gonna make me a [G]big star.   'Cause [A]I can play the [A7]part so [D]well.[D7]

Well I [G]hope you'll come and see me in the [C]movies.   [G]Then I'll know that you will plainly [D]see,
