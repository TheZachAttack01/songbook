[G]     [G]     [D]     [C]       [G]     [D]     [C] 


Well I [G]heard some people [D]talkin' just the [C]other day.  
And they [G]said you were gonna [D]put me on a [C]shelf.
Let-me-tell-you-I [G]got some news for [D]you, and you'll [C]soon find out it's true,  
And then you'll [G]have to eat your [D]lunch all by your[C]self.


'Cause I'm [G]all-[D]all ready [C]gone.   And I'm [G]feee-[D]eelin' [C]strong.  
I will [G]siin-[D]ing this vict'ry [C]song, woo hoo [G]hoo, my [D]my, woo hoo [C]hoo.


The [G]letter that you [D]wrote me, made me [C]stop and wonder why.  
But I [G]guess you felt like you [D]had to set things [C]right.
[G]Just remember [D]this my girl, when you [C]look up in the sky,
You can [G]see the stars and [D]still not see the [C]light (that's right).


And I'm [G]all-[D]all ready [C]gone.   And I'm [G]feee-[D]eelin' [C]strong.
I will [G]siin-[D]ing this vict'ry [C]song, woo hoo [G]hoo[D], woo hoo [C]hoo.


[G] [D]     [C][;]       [G]     [D]     [C][;]       [G]     [D]     [C][;]       [G]     [D]     [C]
 

Well I [G]know it wasn't [D]you who held me [C]down.  
Heaven [G]knows it wasn't [D]you who set me [C]free.
So [G]often times it [D]happens, that we [C]live our lives in chains,  
And we [G]never even [D]know we have the [C]key.


But me I'm [G]all-[D]ll ready [C]gone.   And I'm [G]feee-[D]eelin' [C]strong.
I will [G]siin-[D]ing this vict'ry [C]song.   'Cause I'm [G]al-[D]all ready [C]gone. 


Yes I'm allllllll-[G]all ready [F]gone.   And I'm [C]feee-[G]eelin' [F]strong.
I will [C]siin-[G]ing this vict'ry [F]song.   'Cause I'm [C]al[G]-all ready [F]gone.


Yes I'm [C]all- [G]all ready [F]gone.   [C]All- [G]all ready [F]gone.   All right, nighty-night.
