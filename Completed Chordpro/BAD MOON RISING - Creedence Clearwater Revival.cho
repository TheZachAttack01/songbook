     [D]     [A][-][G]     [D]

I see, a [A]bad [G]moon a[D]risin'.   I see, [A]trouble [G]on the [D]way.
I see, [A]earth[G]quakes and [D]lightnin'.   I see, [A]bad [G]times to[D]day.


[G]Don't go around tonight, well it's [D]bound to take your life.    
[A]There's a [G]bad moon on the [D]rise.


I hear, [A]hurri[G]canes a [D]blowin'.   I know, the [A]end is [G]comin' [D]soon.
[D]I fear, [A]rivers [G]over[D]flowin'.   I hear, the [A]voice of [G]rage 'n [D]ruin.


[G]Don't go around tonight, well it's [D]bound to take your life.    
[A]There's a [G]bad moon on the [D]rise.

Hope you, [A]got your [G]things to[D]gether.   Hope you, are [A]quite pre[G]pared to [D]die.  
Looks like, we're [A]in for [G]nasty [D]weather.   One eye, is [A]taken [G]for an [D]eye.


Wellll [G]don't go around tonight, well it's [D]bound to take your life.    
[A]There's a [G]bad moon on the [D]rise.


[G]Don't go around tonight, well it's [D]bound to take your life.
