TIP:  For the intro and bridge, to play the (EC#) you're already playing an (E) so keep form and just add your pinky to the cover the 2nd string/2nd fret (c).  If transposing, first change the (EC#) to an (Amaj7).   

   
[INTRO:]     [E][,]     [EC#][-][A][;]       [D][,]     [G][-][D][-][E][;]       [E]     [E]     [E]


My child arrived just the [G]other day.    He [A]came to the world in the [E]usual way.
But there were planes to catch, and [G]bills to pay.    [A]He learned to walk while I [E]was away.
And he was [D]talkin' 'fore I knew it, and [Bm]as  he grew, he'd say, "[G]I'm gonna be like [E]you, dad.
"You [G]know I'm gonna [Bm]be like [E]you." [E][,]     [|][E][|][-][|][E][|][-][|][E][|]


And the cat's in the cradle and the [D]silver spoon.    [G]Little boy blue and the [E]man in the moon.

"When you coming home dad?"
"I [D]don't know when, but [G]we'll get together [E]then.    You [G]know we'll have a [Bm]good time [E]then."

My son turned ten just the [G]other day.    He said "[A]Thanks for the ball dad come [E]on let's play.
 
Can you teach me to throw?"
I said "Ah [G]not today I got a [A]lot to do" he said "[E]That's okay."
And he, he [D]walked away but his [Bm]smile never dimmed it said [G]I'm gonna be like [E]him, yeah, 
You [G]know I'm gonna [Bm]be like [E]him. [|][E][|][-][|][E][|][-][|][E][|]


And the cat's in the cradle and the [D]silver spoon.    [G]Little boy blue and the [E]man in the moon.

"When you coming home dad?"
"I [D]don't know when, but [G]we'll get together [E]then.    You [G]know we'll have a [Bm]good time [E]then."


[E][,]     [EC#][-][A][;]       [D][,]     [G][-][D][-][E][,]     [E]
 

Well he came from college just the [G]other day, so [A]much like a man I just [E]had to say,
"Son I'm proud of you, can you [G]sit for a while?"
He [A]shook his head, and he [E]said with a smile,
"What I'd [D]really like Dad is to [Bm]borrow the car keys.    [G]See you later can I [E]have them please?" [|][E][|][-][|][E][|][-][|][E][|]


And the cat's in the cradle and the [D]silver spoon.    [G]Little boy blue and the [E]man in the moon.

"When you coming home son?"
"I [D]don't know when, but [G]we'll get together [E]then, Dad, you [G]know we'll have a [Bm]good time [E]then."


[C] [D]     [E]     [E][,]       [C]     [D]     [E]     [E]     [E]     [E]


I've long since retired my [G]son's moved away.    [A]I called him up just the [E]other day. 
I said "I'd like to see you if [G]you don't mind."
He said "I'd [A]love to Dad if I could [E]find the time.
You see my [D]new job's a hassle and the [Bm]kids have the flu.
But it's [G]sure nice talkin' to [E]you Dad, it's been [G]sure nice [Bm]talkin' to [E]you.


And as I [D]hung up the phone it o[Bm]ccurred to me, he'd [G]grown up just like [E]me.
My [G]boy was just like [E]me. [E][,]     [|][E][|][-][|][E][|][-][|][E][|]
 

And the cat's in the cradle and the [D]silver spoon.    [G]Little boy blue and the [E]man in the moon.

"When you coming home son?"
"I [D]don't know when," but [G]we'll get together [E]then, Dad, we're [G]gonna have a [Bm]good time [E]then.
