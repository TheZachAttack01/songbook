TIP:  There's one (CaddG) in the intro.  If transposing, play the root chord of the transposed (CaddG) and add the 5th note as necessary.

TIP:  I don't know what Willie did with the reprise, raised and flattened the key maybe - I asked him about it one time but he got all pissed off and threw a Lone Star at me (I think the IRS was hounding him at the time) - but whatever he did really resulted in some messed up the chords.  (C#) is played like a (D/A) slid down in the first fret, (Bbm) is like (Bm) in the first fret, (Cm) is like (Bm) in the 3rd fret, and (G#) is like (F) in the 4th fret.  But you know what, why not just play the reprise with chords from the previous verse (indicated by >>>).  They finish the song just as well.
 
TIP:  Patsy and Willie sing the song a little differently, Patsy more hauntingly, and it's Patsy's version that appears here.
