TIP:  The intro is awkward to play.  Cover the 5th string/1st fret <a#> with your middle finger and with your pinky hovering over, but not touching, the fretboard like you’re about to play a barre with the pinky.  Now pick/strum the open 3rd and 4th strings together and drop your pinky down lightly to mute all the strings.  Strum the muted strings with a scraping sound.  Now drop the index finger onto the 4th string/1st fret - like an (Em) but in the first fret – and pick/strum the 4rd and 5th strings together.  Mute the strings again with the pinky and strum a scraping sound again.  Now lift briefly the pinky again and strum the 4th and 5th strings together. Repeat this second part 3 more times and proceed into the song.  (The notes may or may not transpose.)  For the untransposed it's the 3rd and 4th strings together g/d, and then the covered 4th and 5th strings together a#/b.
