TIP:  In the step-down instrumental bit of the at the end of the chorus, and again in the bridge, focus on the middle strings.

TIP:  After the instrumental bridge the song is sung acapella but the chords are there if you want to play them.

TIP:  In the outro, it's subtle but Freddie sings the first two lines like the ones before, then the next two are sung up-inflection (beginning with (D) rather than (Bb), then another line like before, and then another up-inflection.  If this is too bothersome stick with the pattern that begins with the (Bb).
