There's also a version in G.

TIP:  The intro is awkward to play.  Form (A) with your middle fingers and lightly rest your pinky like a barre across strings so theyâ€™re muted.  Now lift off the pinky and pick/strum the 3rd and 4th strings together, lay the pinky down again to mute all the strings and strum with a scraping sound.  Now lift briefly the pinky again and strum the 4th and 5th strings together.  Pinky down again.  Repeat this second part 3 more times and proceed into the song.  (The notes may or may not transpose.)  For the untransposed it's (A), 3rd and 4th strings together a/e, and then the 4th and 5th strings together e/a.
