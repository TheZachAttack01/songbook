TIP:  Most of the song revolves around a (G)(F)(C) sequence.  It's not hard but is a bit tricky to play correctly.  The intro is the same as the "Na na" part.  The first half starts with two beats of (G), then a brief pause, and then quickly one more beat of (G), then one beat of (F), and then straight up to the (C) for two more beats.  The second half is five beats of (C), one beat of (F), and three more beats of (C).  Think of that move to the (F) and (C) as a "hop".  In the first half, hop from the (G) to the (F) and hop from to (F) to the (C).  In the second half, hop from the (C) to the (F) and back to the (C).

TIP:  That same "hop" from (C) to (F) to (C) also comes around in the chorus on the world "centerfold".  You'll lead with a (C) and then a one-count of |F| at "center" and return to the (C) for "fold."

TIP:  At the end of the verse line is a (F)(C) played as a two-count "bump-bump" with the first chord on the last syllable of the word and the second chord played after the word.  In the prechorus is something similar with a (C)(D) played as a two-note walk-up.  Both are quickly followed by the first chord of the next line.
