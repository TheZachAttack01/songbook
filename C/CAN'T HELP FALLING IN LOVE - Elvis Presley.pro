TIP:  If transposing play the root chord of the transposed (CaddG) and add the 5th note as necessary.  The notes at the end of the song may or may not transpose at all.

TIP:  Strike/strum each chord on the downstroke.  Subsequent chord strumming patterns can then be either alternating strokes or all downstrokes if you wish.

TIP:  Untransposed, you finish the song on a (C).  While holding (C), pick the notes.  They are:  3 - 2 - 1 - P - 1 - 2 - 3- 2 - 1 - P - 1 - 2, where "P" means 1st string/3rd fret.  So you walk down the fingerboard from the 3rd string, add your pinky, lift your pinky, walk back up the fingerboard to the 3rd string, repeat, and end with a (CaddG).
