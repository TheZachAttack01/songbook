The intro is all pinky work.  For the (D) segment hold (D) and add pinky to 1st string 3rd fret, lift to get back to (D) and then lift off the middle finger for (Dsus2).  For (C)-|Cadd9|-(C) hold (C) and add pinky to 2nd string/3rd fret for one count and then lift.  For (D)-(DaddA) add pinky to 1st string/5th fret.  (If transposing play the root chord after the transposed (DaddA) and add the 5th note as necessary.)
