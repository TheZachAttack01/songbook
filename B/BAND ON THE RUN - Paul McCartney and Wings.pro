TIP:  There are 3 different intros/transitions/bridges before you get to the main body of the song.  The first is that weepy opening instrumental followed by "Stuck inside these four walls . . . ".  The second is a transitional riff that leads into a second bridge ("If I ever get out of here . . ."), and then a "normal" instrumental intro for the main song.  Once you get to actual freakin' song the rest is pretty straight forward.

     Part one:  Emphasizing the treble strings, strike each chord (or note) once through the first (Dmaj7) and pause.  Then comes the first twiddle.  "Twiddle" is that sing-song back, string bending whatever it is Denny is playing there but to emulate it just strum the three treble strings of the chord just played.  The first is the (Dmaj7), followed with one strum each of the (Dmaj7) (D) (Em).  Another twiddle on the (Em).  The whole sequence repeats.  Then strike the (Gm) purposefully once and slide quickly down and strike the (Dmaj7), then lift off (all strings open) and strike the open strings, and then a (D).  Finish with one strike each of (D) (Em) (Gm).  Now repeat that whole sequence and at the end hold and pause on the final (Gm).  It sounds messier than it is (thank God). 
     
    Part two:  Mercifully straight forward.  Like the mention above, when you come across <open> it's one-strum with no fingers on the fingerboard (all strings open), but remember to hit the 1st string.  As for the (Am) (Asus2) (Asus2) (Am) bit the (Asus2) is just (Am) without the index finger.  Easy.  Also has a (D) <open> - (Am).  This is a transitional chord from the (D) you lift off (no fingers) for just one strum and then immediately to the (Am).
 
     Part three:  Six hard strums on the (C/G) emphasizing the top 4 bass strings.  The transition between (C) and (Fmaj7) and back isn't hard, and you're going to have to get it down because it's played throughout the chorus as well.  The key is to hold the index finger where it is and move up your other fingers up and down one fret as necessary, like a pivot.  But in the chorus, if you can't deal with the (Fmaj7) in the "band on the run" you can just play the (C) throughout.}

Well the [C]undertaker drew a [Fmaj7]heavy sigh, seeing no one else had [C]come.
And a bell was ringing in the [Fmaj7]village square, for the rabbits on the [Em]run.
