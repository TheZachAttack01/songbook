[INTRO:]     [C]     [F]     [C]     [F]     [C]     [G]     [C]


One evening [F]as the [C]sun went [F]down and the [C]jungle [G]fire was [C]burn[CaddG]ing.  
Down the [C]track came a [F]hobo [C]hikin’, and-he-said- "Boys [G]I'm not [C]turn[CaddG]ing.  
I'm [F]headed-for-a [C]land that's [F]far a[C]way, be[F]sides the [C]crystal [G]fountains. 
So [C]come with [F]me we'll [C]go and [F]see the [C]Big Rock [G]Candy [C] Mountains."


In the Big Rock [G]Candy [C]Mountains, there's a [F]land that's fair and [C]bright.
Where the [F]handouts grow on [C]bushes, and you [F]sleep [C]out every [G]night.
Where the [C]boxcars all are emp[CaddG]ty,        and the [F]sun shines every [C]day,
On the [F]birds and the [C]bees and the [F]cigarette [C]trees, 
The [F]lemonade [C]springs where the [F]bluebird [C]sings in the Big Rock Candy [G]Moun[C]tains.


In the Big Rock [G]Candy [C]Mountains, all the [F]cops have wooden [C]legs.
And the [F]bulldogs all have [C]rubber teeth, and the [F]hens [C]lay soft-boiled [G]eggs.
The [C]farmers' trees are full of [CaddG]fruit,     and the [F]barns are full of [C]hay.
Oh I'm [F]bound to [C]go where there [F]ain't no [C]snow
Where the [F]rain don't [C]fall the [F]winds don't [C]blow in the Big Rock Candy [G]Moun[C]tains.


In the Big Rock [G]Candy [C]Mountains, you [F]never change your [C]socks.
And the [F]little streams of [C]alcohol, come [F]trick[C]ling down the [G]rocks.
The [C]brakemen have to tip their [CaddG]hats     and the [F]railroad bulls are [C]blind.
There's a [F]lake of [C]stew and of [F]whiskey [C]too, 
You can [F]paddle all a[C]round ‘em in a [F]big can[C]oe.  In the Big Rock Candy [G]Moun[C]tains.


In the Big Rock [G]Candy [C]Mountains, the [F]jails are made of [C]tin.
And [F]you can walk right [C]out again, as [F]soon [C]as you are [G]in.
There [C]ain't no short-handled [CaddG]shovels, no [F]axes saws nor [C]picks.
I'm [F]goin’ to [C]stay where you [F]sleep all [C]day
Where they [F]hung the [C]jerk that in[F]vented [C]work in the Big Rock Candy [G]Moun[C]tains.


<whistle>     [C]     [F]     [C][,]     [F][-][C][,]    [F][-][C]       I'll [F]see you [C]all this [F]coming [C]fall in the Big Rock Candy [G]Moun[C]tains.
