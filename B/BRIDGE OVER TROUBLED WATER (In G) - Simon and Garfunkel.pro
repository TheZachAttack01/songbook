TIP:  A lot of chord variations but that's all they are, just variations from the major.  The  (D7sus2) will follow the (D7) so just lift the ring finger.  The (Cadd9) will follow the (C) so just just play (C) and add pinky to second string/3rd fret.  The (Cmaj7) will also follow the (C) so just lift off the index finger.  (CaddG) is just (C) with pinky added to 1st string/3rd fret and emulates Artie's voice raising on the same note to a higher octave.

TIP:  If transposing, play the root chord of the transposed (CaddG) adding the 5th note as necessary.
