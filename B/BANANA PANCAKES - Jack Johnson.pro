TIP:  For the opening notes in the intro, form up (G) and pick the string indicates, “O5” and “O6” meaning the open 5th and open 6th strings respectively.  (Notes may or may not transpose.)  Finish each string with the chord indicated, first the (Am) and then the (G).

Well can't you see that it's just [Am]raining?  [Am7]
There ain't no need to go out[G]side.


But [D]baby you [G]hardly even [C]notice, [G]when I try to [C]show you this,
[G]Song it's meant to [C]keep ya, from [G]doing what you're ‘[C]sposed to,
[G]Wakin’ up too [C]early, [G]maybe we could [C]sleep in,
[G]Make you banana [C]pancakes, pre[G]tend like it's the [C]weekend [Am]now. [Am]


And we could pretend it all the [G]time. [G]
Can't you see that it's just [Am]rainin’?  [Am7]
There ain't no need to go out[G]side. [G]


But just [D]maybe ha [G]laka uku[C]lele, [G]mama made a [C]baby, 
[G]Really don't mind the [C]practice ‘cause [G]you're my little [C]lady,
[G]Lady lady [C]love me 'cause I [G]love to lay here [C]lazy.
[G]We could close the [C]curtains, pre[G]tend like there's no [C]world, [Am]outside. [Am]


And we could pretend it all the [G]time no.
And can't you see that it's just [Am]raining?  [Am7]
There ain't no need to go out[G]side. [G]
Ain't no need ain't no [Am]need, [Am]         Mmm-mmm-mmm-[G]mmm. [G]
Can't you see can't you [Am]see? [Am]         Rain all day and I don't [G]mind. [G]


But the [Am]telephone singin’ ringin’ it's too early don't pick it [D]up. [D]
We don't need to we got [Am]everything we need right here and everything we need is e[D]nough.
Just so easy when the [Bm]whole world fits inside of your arms,
Do we [Em]really need to pay attention [C]to the alarm?
Wake up [G]slow, mmm-[Am]mmm, wake up [G]slow. [G]


But [D]baby you [G]hardly even [C]notice, [G]when I try to [C]show you this,
[G]Song it's meant to [C]keep ya, from [G]doing what you're ‘[C]posed to,
[G]Wakin’ up too [C]early, [G]maybe we could [C]sleep in,
[G]Make you banana [C]pancakes, pre[G]tend like it's the [C]weekend [Am]now. [Am]


And we could pretend it all the [G]time. [G]
And can't you see that it's just [Am]rainin’?  [Am7]
There ain't no need to go out[G]side. [G]


Ain't no need ain't no [Am]need. [Am]         Rain all day and I [G]really really really don't mind.
Can't you see can't you [Am]see?  [Am]         We've got to wake up [|] s[G]low.[|]
