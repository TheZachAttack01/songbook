Originally written and performed in the key of C on the O Brother soundtrack.  Here it is capo'd at the 5th fret as most find it easier to move between (C) and (G) than between (C) and (F).

TIP:  If transposing, play the root chord of the transposed (Gadd) adding the 5th note as necessary.


[INTRO:]     [G]     [C]     [G]     [C]     [G]     [D]     [G]


One evening [C]as the [G]sun went [C]down and the [G]jungle [D]fire was [G]burn[Gadd]ing.  
Down the [G]track came a [C]hobo [G]hikin’, and-he-said- "Boys [D]I'm not [G]turn[Gadd]ing.  
I'm [C]headed-for-a [G]land that's [C]far a[G]way, be[C]sides the [G]crystal [D]fountains.  
So [G]come with [C]me we'll [G]go and [C]see the [G]Big Rock [D]Candy [G]Mountains."


In the Big Rock [D]Candy [G]Mountains, there's a [C]land that's fair and [G]bright.
Where the [C]handouts grow on [G]bushes, and you [C]sleep [G]out every [D]night.
Where the [G]boxcars all are emp[Gadd]ty,      and the [C]sun shines every [G]day,
On the [C]birds and the [G]bees and the [C]cigarette [G]trees,
The [C]lemonade [G]springs where the [C]bluebird [G]sings, in the Big Rock Candy [D]Moun[G]tains.


In the Big Rock [D]Candy [G]Mountains, all the [C]cops have wooden [G]legs.
And the [C]bulldogs all have [G]rubber teeth, and the [C]hens [G]lay soft-boiled [D]eggs.
The [G]farmers' trees are full of [Gadd]fruit,   and the [C]barns are full of [G]hay.
Oh I'm [C]bound to [G]go where there [C]ain't no [G]snow,
Where the [C]rain don't [G]fall the [C]winds don't [G]blow, in the Big Rock Candy [D]Moun[G]tains.


In the Big Rock [D]Candy [G]Mountains, you [C]never change your [G]socks.
And the [C]little streams of [G]alcohol, come [C]trick[G]ling down the [D]rocks.
The [G]brakemen have to tip their [Gadd]hats   and the [C]railroad bulls are [G]blind.
There's a [C]lake of [G]stew and of [C]whiskey [G]too,
You can [C]paddle all a[G]round ‘em in a [C]big can[G]oe.  In the Big Rock Candy [D]Moun[G]tains.
 

In the Big Rock [D]Candy [G]Mountains, the [C]jails are made of [G]tin.
And [C]you can walk right [G]out again, as [C]soon [G]as you are [D]in.
There [G]ain't no short-handled [Gadd]shovels, no [C]axes saws nor [G]picks.
I'm [C]goin’ to [G] stay where you [C]sleep all [G]day,
Where they [C]hung the [G]jerk that in[C]vented [G]work.  In the Big Rock Candy [D]Moun[G]tains.


<whistle>   [G]     [C]     [G][,]     [C][-][G][,]   [C][-][G]       I'll [C]see you [G]all this [C]coming [G] fall in the Big Rock Candy [D]Moun[G]tains.
