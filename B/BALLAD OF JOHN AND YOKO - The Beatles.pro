[INTRO:]   [(][Galloping][)]     [D]


Standing in the dock at Southampton, trying to get to Holland or France.
The [D7]man in the mac said "You've got to turn back"
You know they didn't even give us a chance Christ you know it ain't [G]easy.  
You know how hard it can [D]be.  
The way things are [A7]goin', they're going to crucify [D]me. [|][D][|][-][|][A7][|][-][|][A7][|][-][D]


Finally made the plane into Paris, honeymooning down by the Seine.  
Peter [D7]Brown-called-to-say, "You can make it okay,
You can get married in Gibraltar near Spain" Christ you know it ain't [G]easy.  
You know how hard it can [D]be.
The way things are [A7]goin', they're going to crucify [D]me. [|][D][|][-][|][A7][|][-][|][A7][|][-][D]


Drove from Paris to the Amsterdam Hilton.   Talking in our beds for a week.  
The [D7]newspapers said "Say what you doing in bed?
I said "We're only trying to get us some peace" Christ you know it ain't [G]easy.  
You know how hard it can [D]be.
The way things are [A7]goin', they're going to crucify [D]me. [|][D][|][-][|][D][|][-][|][D][|][-][|][D][|][-][|][D][|][-][|][D][|][-][|][D][|]


[G]Saving up your money for a rainy day, giving all your clothes to charity.

Last night the wife said, "Oh boy when you're dead 
You [A7]don't take nothing with you but your so-oul think!"


[|][A][|][-][|][A][|][-][|][A][|][-][D] Made a lightning trip to Vienna.   Eating chocolate cake in a bag.
The [D7]newspapers said, "She's gone to his head,
They look just like two gurus in drag" Christ you know it ain't [G]easy.  
You know how hard it can [D]be.
The way things are [A7]goin', they're going to crucify [D]me. [|][D][|][-][|][D][|][-][|][D][|][-][|][D][|][-][|][D][|][-][|][D][|][-][|][D][|]


Caught the early plane back to London.   Fifty acorns tied in a sack.
The [D7]men from the press said, "We wish you success,
It's good to have the both of you back" Christ you know it ain't [G]easy.  
You know how hard it can [D]be.
The way things are [A7]goin', they're going to crucify [D]me.

The way things are [A7]goin', they're going to crucify [D]me.  [A][.][.][.]     [A7]       [A7]       [|][D][|][|][G][|][-][|][G][|][-][|][A][|][-][|][D][|]
