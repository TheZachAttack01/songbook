TIP:  Unlikely to transpose well.

TIP:  For the |EC#| you just hold (E) and firmly plant the pinky on the 2nd string/2nd fret and then single downstroke the |EC#| focusing on the bottom three strings.

TIP:  In the verse the timing of the transition from the trailing |EC#| to the (D) is a little tricky as the (D) blends into the first word of the next line.  You'll see what I mean when you play it.

TIP:  For the guitar solos after 8 measures of (E) you'll have two downstokes of |E/G| in which you just keep the (E) form and add your pinky to the 1st string/3rd fret, and then lift to get back to the (E).
