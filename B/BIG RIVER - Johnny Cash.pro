TIP:  The intro and instrumental bridges have a quick little 6-note step-down thing going on.  It’s hard to describe but it’ll be obvious.  Focus on the 3rd and 4th strings. 


[INTRO][:]     [D]     [D][-][D][,]     [D]     [D][-][D][,]     [D]     [.] [.] [.]


Now I taught the weepin’ willow how to cry, 
And I showed the clouds how to cover, up a [E]clear blue [A]sky.
And the [D]tears that I cried for that woman, are gonna [G]flood you Big River.
And [D]I'm gonna sit right [A]here until I [D]die.


I met her accidentally in St. Paul, Minnesota.
And it tore me up every time I heard her [E]drawl southern [A]drawl.
Then I [D]heard my dream was back downstream, ca[G]vortin' in Davenport,
And I [D]followed you Big [A]River, when you [D]called.


[D] [D][-][D][,]     [D]     [D][-][D][,]     [D]     [D][-][G][,]     [G]     [G][-][D][,]     [D]     [D][-][A][,]     [A]     [A][-][D]


Then you took me to St. Louis, later on, down the river.
A freighter said she's been here, but she's [E]gone boy she's [A]gone.
I [D]found her trail in Memphis, but she [G]just walked up the bluff.
She raised a [D]few eyebrows and then [A]she went on down a[D]lone.


Now won't you bat it down by Baton Rouge, River Queen roll it on.
Take that woman on down to New Or[E]leans, New Or[A]leans.
Go [D]on I've had enough, dump my [G]blues down in the gulf.
[D]She loves you Big [A]River, more than [D]me.


[D] [D][-][D][,]     [D]     [D][-][D][,]     [D]     [D][-][G][,]     [G]     [G][-][D][,]     [D]     [D][-][A][,]     [A]     [A][-][D]


Now I taught the weepin’ willow how to cry cry cry. 
And I showed the clouds how to cover, up a [E]clear blue [A]sky.
And the [D]tears that I cried for that woman, are gonna [G]flood you Big River.
And [D]I'm gonna sit right [A]here until I [D]die.   [D]     [|][D][|]
