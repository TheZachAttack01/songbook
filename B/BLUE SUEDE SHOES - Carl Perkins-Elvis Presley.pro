TIP:  The chord in |brackets} means strum once at that point.

TIP:  For a zingy rendition, play the (A) as an (AA5) - barre 2nd fret and then extend your pinky over to the 1st string two frets over from the barre to grab the treble (a).  Then you can hammer/on/off the pinky while strumming.  In the instrumental bridge you do the same for second (D) by playing a (DaddA).

TIP:  Carl plays a nice little twinkle lick at the end.  Start with the (AA5) and then lift up while holding the barre (A6), lift off the 1st string (A), play an (E), and then another (A).  Finish with one strum of (A6+) in which you keep the (A) and just add your pinky to the 1st string of the 3rd fret.
