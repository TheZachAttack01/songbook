TIP:  The intro chords echo the refrain "Do wah diddy . . ."  Then, without chords (NC), sing the opening line until you reach the first (C) in "Do wah".

TIP:  The last two lines of each verse has single strums of |G|.  These are not in the recording which Paul sings a capella but it helps to play them for timing.

TIP:  The bridges are a bit tricky to get the vocals right.  First, there are notes prior to the beginning of each line - which can be ignored - but if you play them the first ones can begin on the open 3rd string (g) while holding the trailing (C), then drop your middle finger down to cover the 3rd string/3rd fret (a), lift off the index finger and pick the open 2nd string (b), and replace it to play the (c).  Next, "Whoa" is sung as a four syllable, sing-song kind of thing.  Also note the last line in the bridge is a run-on sentence so you have to keep up.  Listen to the song and you'll hear what I mean.
