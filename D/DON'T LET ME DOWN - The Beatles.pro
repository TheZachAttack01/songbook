If transposing, play the root chord of the transposed (G/F#).

For the intro strum the chord and pick the notes (notes may or may not transpose).  If untransposed:  Strum (D).  Still holding (D):  (1) Add pinky to 4th string/4th fret and pluck the 4th string (f#).  (2) Pluck the 3rd string (a).  (3) Move your pinky down to the 2nd string/3rd fret and pick the 3rd string (b).  (4) Lift off the pinky and pick 3rd string (a).  (5) Move index finger to 4th string/2nd fret and pick 4th string (e).  (6) Pluck the open 3rd string (g).  (7) Pinky back to 4th string/4th fret and pluck 4th string (f#).

TIP:  That messy looking chord series is actually pretty simple to play.  To move from (Em) to (Em7) just lift off the bottom finger and replace it again to get back to the (Em).  Play (G/F#) like you're going to play a (G7) except slide your index finger up into the 2nd fret, or like you're going to play a regular (G) and slide everything into the 2nd fret, just don't hit the top string.  Not hard at all.  And to go from (D) to (D4) and back just add and remove your pinky to 1st string/3rd fret.

TIP:  (NC) means no chord so sing a cappella while |D| in brackets means to strum gently just once, sort of a place keeper, although you can skip it completely if you want to sing a cappela until the (Em).
