If transposing you can try playing the transposed root chords, adding the 5th and 9th notes as necessary, but it's probably going to be a bit messy, especially if the (c) on "the" in "Dust in the wind" doesn't transpose.

TIP:  Don't be freaked by all the add chords, the song is actually pretty easy to play.

TIP:  First the intro.  You can strum the chords or, here's your chance to fingerpick.  The intro is pretty easy but it's in two parts with minor variations.

     Part One:  Start with (C), lift off the index finger to get to (Cmaj7), reform (C) but add pinky to the 2nd string/3rd fret for (Cadd9), and lift off the pinky and your back at (C).  Next is (Asus2) which is (Am) without the index finger.  Play the (Asus) as (Am) with your pinky added to 2nd string/3rd fret (the pinky will cancel the index finger).  Now just lift off the pinky and you'll be at (Am).  Lift off the index finger and you're back to (Asus2).

     Part Two:  Like part one but you invert the order, beginning and ending with (Cadd9) with (C) and (Cmaj7) in between.  Same thing with the (A) series, you start and end with (Am) with (Asus2) an (Asus) in between.  See the pattern?  Clever boy, Kerry!

TIP:  Next is the "Dust in the wind" part.  You begin the line with (Gadd) and then there's a three-count (one strum each) where you lift off the (Gadd) and stab the 2nd string/1st fret (c) on "in", then lift off completely (NC) for "the", and finish with an (Am) on wind.  Boom-boom-boom.  Easy!  When you don't see this pattern the voicing in the lyric ends on an up-inflection.  In the last line of the song "in the wind" ends deeply.

TIP:  Finally, in the second part of the violin bridge, think like a violin bow as you "saw" up the scale with rapid strums of the (Am)... ending at the top with the (CaddG), and then "saw" down the scale with rapid strums of the (CaddG) ending the (G)(Am).
