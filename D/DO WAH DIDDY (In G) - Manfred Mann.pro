{t: DO WAH DIDDY (In G) – Manfred Mann}
{st: (Barry/Greenwich)}
{artist: Manfred Mann}
{composer: Barry; Greenwich}


TIP:  If transposing, play the root chord of the transposed (Gadd) adding the 5th note as necessary.

TIP:  The intro chords echo the refrain "Do wah diddy . . ."  Then, without chords (NC), sing the opening line until you reach the first (G) in "Do wah".

TIP:  The last two lines of each verse has single strums of |G|.  These are not in the recording which Paul sings a capella but it helps to play them for timing.

TIP:  The bridges are a bit tricky to get the vocals right.  First, there are notes prior to the beginning of each line - which can be ignored - but if you play them the first ones can begin on either the open 4th string (d) while holding the trailing (G), or begin with a (D) and start with the covered ring finger on the 2nd string/third fret, lifting and covering as necessary and then switching back to the (G).  I find the latter a bit easier.   Next, "Whoa" is sung as a four syllable, sing-song kind of thing.  Also note the last line in the bridge is a run-on sentence so you have to keep up.  Listen to the song and you'll hear what I mean.
