TIP:  The chords in the little bridge between the verse and chorus are meant to be struck once each.  This is based on the Monkees version but Anne’s is nearly identical with just minor differences in the lyrics.
 
      
[INTRO:]     [G]     [D7][,]     [G]     [D7]


Oh I could [G]hide, ‘neath the [Am]wings, of the [Bm]bluebird as she [C]sings.
The [G]six o’clock a[Em]larm, would never [A7]ring. [D7]
But it [G]rings, and I [Am]rise, wipe the [Bm]sleep out of my [C]eyes.
My [G]shavin’ [Em]razor’s [C]cold [D7]and it [G]stings. 

[|][G][|][-][|][D][|][-][|][Em][|][-][|][Am][|][-][|][G][|][-][|][D][|][-][|][G][|]


[C]Cheer up [D]sleepy [Bm]Jean.   [C]Oh what [D]can it [Em]mean?
[C]To a, [G]     daydream be[C]liever and a [G]homecom[Em]ing  [A7]queen. [D7]  


[G]You once thought of [Am]me, as a [Bm]white knight on a [C]steed.
[G]Now you know how [Em]happy, I can [A7]be.  [D7]
Oh and our [G]good times starts and [Am]end, without [Bm]dollar one to [C]spend.
But [G]how much [Em]baby [C]do we [D7]really [G]need?
