(Sorry, I could not find or create an arrangement with friendly chords that matches the original recording.  But this one is pretty and fairly easy to play.)

TIP:  Prior to the (Fmaj7) you’ll be playing (C) so just keep the index finger down and drop the ring and middle fingers down one string.  After the (Fmaj7) just drop your index finger down on the bottom two strings as a mini-barre for the (Gsus4).

TIP:  Not too fast.
     

[C]Your day breaks, [Em]your mind aches, 
[Am]You find that [C]all her words of [Fmaj7]kindness linger [Gsus4]on       when she no [C]longer needs you.


She wakes up, [Em]she makes up, 
[Am]She takes her [C]time and doesn't [Fmaj7]feel    she has to [Gsus4]hurry,  she no [C]longer needs you.


And in her [Dm]eyes you see [A7]nothing, 
[Dm]No sign of [A7]love behind the [Dm]tears, cried for [A7]no one.
[Dm]A    love that [A7]should have lasted [Dm]years. [Gsus4]            [G] 


[C]You want her, [Em]you need her, 
[Am]And yet you [C]don't believe her [Fmaj7]when  she says her [Gsus4]love     is dead.   You [C]think she needs you.


[C] [Em]       [Am]       [C]     [Fmaj7]            [Gsus4]            [C]


And in her [Dm]eyes you see [A7]nothing, 
[Dm]No sign of [A7]love behind the [Dm]tears, cried for [A7]no one.
[Dm]A    love that [A7]should have lasted [Dm]years. [Gsus4]            [G] 


[C]You stay home, [Em]she goes out, 
[Am]She says that [C]long ago she [Fmaj7]knew someone, but [Gsus4]now     he's gone she [C]doesn't need him.


Your day breaks, [Em]your mind aches, 
[Am]There will be [C]times when all the [Fmaj7]things she said will [Gsus4]fill        your head, you [C]won't forget her.


And in her [Dm]eyes you see [A7]nothing, 
[Dm]No sign of [A7]love behind the [Dm]tears, cried for [A7]no one.
[Dm]A    love that [A7]should have lasted [Dm]years. [Gsus4]            [G]
