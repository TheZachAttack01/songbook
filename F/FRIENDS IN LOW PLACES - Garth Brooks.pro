TIP:  The intro and opening verse has a couple of funky chords but they're not hard to play and once you get past the first verse you won't see them again.  So first play the (A) with your middle three fingers.  For the (A#dim7) you leave the ring finger where it is and move your middle finger up one string, like you're playing an (A7), and use your index finger to cover the 5th string/1st fret.  For the (Bm7) hold the finger formation but drop your ring and middle finger down one string and slide your index finger up one fret.  Easy!  But if you just don't want to deal with any of it in the first place then play an (A7) in place of the (A#dim7), and play a (Bm) in place of the (Bm7) and it'll sound just fine (which is what you'll be doing for the rest of the song).

TIP:  The chord/notes combination in the intro means first form (but don't play) the chord and then pick the notes/strings indicated one at a time.  For the untransposed, it's (A) 5 - 4 - 3 - 2, (A#dim7) 5 - 4 - 2 - 1, (Bm7) 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 - 2 - b5, and (E) 6 - 4 - 3 - 2 - b4 where the numbers are strings and b5 and b4 means bottoms string/5th fret and 1st string/4th fret.  Pause before going to the next chord/string combo which also gives you time to move your fingers.

TIP:  In the first verse you'll see chords in |brackets|.  This means strum the chord once at that position.  Notice after "champagne" you start your normal chord strumming.

TIP:  You can kiss my ass.  Yeah, that verse is included even though it's not on the studio version.

[NC]Blame it  [|] [A]all [|]   on my roots,  I  [|] sh[A7]owed[|]  up in boots, and  [|] r[Bm7]uined[|]   your black tie a[|] [Bm]ffair[|].
The  [|]  l[E]ast[|]   one to know, the  [|]  l[E7]ast [|]   one to show I was the  [|]  l[A]ast [|]   one you thought you'd see there.


And  I [|] s[A]aw[|]   the surprise, and the  [|] [A7]fear[|]   in his eyes, when  [|][Bm7]I  [|]   took his glass of cham[|] p[Dm]agne[|].
And [E]I toasted you said “Honey [E7]we may be through, but you'll never hear me com[E]plain.”


'Cause [A]I got friends in low places where the whiskey drowns and the beer chases my [Bm]blues away.  
And I'll [E]be okay.   
Now [A]I'm not big on social graces think I'll slip on down to the [A7]oasis.   Oh [Bm]I     got friends, [E]     in low [A]places.


[A][.][.][.][.]     [Bm]       [E]     [A]


Well I guess I was wrong, I  [A7]just don't belong.   But [Bm]then, I've been there before.
Every[E]thing's all right.   I'll [E7]just say goodnight and I'll [A]show myself to the door.  
Hey I didn't mean, to [A7]cause a big scene.   Just [Bm]give me an hour and [Dm]then.
Well [E]I'll be as high as that [E7]ivory tower, that you're livin' [E]in.


'Cause [A]I got friends in low places where the whiskey drowns and the beer chases my [Bm]blues away.
