TIP:  The intro is a tad tricky.  So start by forming an (E).  Now place your index finger up one string so it's on 4th string/1st fret and lift off the ring finger.  Now pick the 5th string/2nd fret (b) twice, pluck the covered 4th string (d#) twice, pluck the 5th string again.  Now grab the top string at the 2nd fret (f#) with your ring finger and pull/bend the string downward and then let it slide back up.  Release the top string and pluck it (e) along with a strum of (E) and begin song.  For that last part you have to remember to move your index finger back down one string for the (E).  

TIP:  The bridge is meant to be played as notes on the frets 7-10 but you can play the opening notes on the 2nd fret, and then just play chords, and have a pretty good substitute.  You'll end the verse on (E) so just keep the (E) formed throughout (1) - (4) below.  Now stay with me:

     (1)  Pluck the 4th, 3rd, and 2nd, then add pinky to the 2nd string/3rd fret and pluck, remove pinky and pluck, pinky back down and pluck, pinky off and pluck.

     (2)  Now do the same thing but this time end with the pinky down:  Pluck the 4th, 3rd, and 2nd, then add pinky to the 2nd string/3rd fret and pluck, remove pinky and pluck, pinky back down and pluck.

     (3)  Repeat (1) and (2).

     (4)  Now we're going to go in the opposite direction:  Remove pinky from 2nd string and pluck, pluck 3rd string, pluck 4th string.  

     (5)  Lift all fingers and pluck the 5th string (open) once and immediately form and strum (A).  While strumming (A) strike the middle strings with downstrokes followed by alternating up and down strums through the treble strings.

     (6)  Move to (E) with the same strumming pattern.  Then to (B7) with the same strumming pattern, and back to (E) with the same strumming pattern.

TIP:  If you don't want to mess around at all with the individual notes in the bridge then just play (E) throughout steps (1) - (4) while adding/removing your pinky to the 2nd string/3rd fret (E7full) at the appropriate time until it's time to move to the (A) in step (5).  	
      

[INTRO:]       [b][-][b][-][b][-][d#][-][d#][-][b][-][f#]     [<][bend][>]     [e]     [E]


[E]I hear the train a-comin', it's rollin' 'round the bend, 
And I ain't seen the sunshine since, [E7]I   don't know when.
I'm [A7]stuck in Folsom Prison, and time keeps draggin'[E]on. [E]     [E]  
But that [B7]train keeps a-rollin', on down to San An[E]tone.


When I was just a baby, my momma told me "Son, 
Always be a good boy don't [E7]ever play with guns."
But I [A7]shot a man in Reno, just to watch him [E]die. [E]     [E]  
When I [B7]hear that whistle blowin', I hang my head and [E]cry.

I bet there's rich folks eatin' in a fancy dinin' car.  
They're prob'ly drinkin' coffee, and [E7]smokin' big cigars.
Well I [A7]know I had it comin', I know I can't be [E]free. [E]     [E]
But those [B7]people keep a-movin', and that's what tortures [E]me.

Well if they freed me from this prison if that railroad train was mine,  
I bet I'd move it all a little [E7]farther down the line.
[A7]Far from Folsom Prison, that's where I'd want to [E]stay. [E]     [E]  
And I'd [B7]let that lonesome whistle, blow my blues a[E]way.
