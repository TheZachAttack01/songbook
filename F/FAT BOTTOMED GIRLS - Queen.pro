TIP:  The strum bit after the a cappella intro is different on the album version than on the "official video".  The album has four measures while the video has but one.  Four measures is presented here.  Cuz I like it.  It's not important you nail the strum pattern exactly but it is important to the song.  For the most part it consists of steady downbeats.  The instrumental passages in particular are usually 7 steady downward strums of (D), followed by 3 very quick strums of (C), (G), and another (D) and then the pattern immediately repeats.  Listening to the song will help a lot.  The pattern changes a bit at the end from 7 strums of the (D) to 3 and the final one has 9 strums very quickly in an up and down saw-like pattern.

TIP:  If transposing, play the root chord of the transposed (Gadd) adding the 5th note as necessary.

TIP:  (Cadd9) always follows a (C) so just keep the (C) formation and add the pinky to 2nd string/3rd fret.  And whenever you play the (D) wrap your thumb over the top string/2nd fret to grab the bass (f#) (although you can just play just (D) if you want).

TIP:  Sing the opening verse a cappella (as Queen does), or with just one strum of the chords where indicated as sort of a guide.
