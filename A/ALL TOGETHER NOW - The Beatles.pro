TIP:  The intro starts with a single (F#) that quickly jumps into a series of downstroke (G)s.  The (F#) can be skipped if too cumbersome to play but it's just the one stroke.

TIP:  There's a little three note bass riff that opens the chorus (Bom bom bom).  It's not terribly difficult to hit and can be skipped in favor of keeping the (G).  But it goes like this:  You'll end the verse on a (G), so keep the (G) and pick the top covered string <g> and as you transition to (G) lift off the top string and pick the open 5th string <a>, and then use your index finger to cover the 5th string/2nd fret (b) before finishing/continuing on the (G).  Sounds messy, it's not, just takes a little quick finger movement during the transition.  These notes may or may not transpose.
