TIP:  For the intro and first word of the first verse pick the open 2nd string (b).  In the intro strum each chord once where it appears and begin strumming on "always" after you pick the (b) on "And".  The notes may or may not transpose.
 
TIP:  The (Em) - (Am) - (D7) series is the “whistling part”.  After the key change at the end it’s (F#m) - (D7) - (E7).

TIP:  I included all of Eric Idle's bits at the end which he speaks over the outro.  No reason, other than it's the Pythons.  Go on then.  


[b]Some  [|] t[Am]hings[|]   in life are  [|] b[D]ad.[|]     They can  [|] re[G]ally[|]   make you  [|][Em]mad.[|]
[|][Am]Other[|]   things just  [|]m[D]ake[|]   you swear and  [|] c[G]urse.[|]
When you're  [|] ch[Am]ewing[|]   on life's  [|] gr[D]istle,[|]   don't  [|] gr[G]umble,[|]   give a  [|] w[Em]histle.[|]
And  [|] t[Am]his'll[|]   help things turn out for the [|] b[D7]est.[|]


[b]And, [G]always [Em]look on the [Am7]bright  [D7]side of [G]life. [Em][-][Am][-][D]
[G]Always [Em]look on the [Am7]light   [D7] side of [G]life. [Em][-][Am][-][D]


If [Am]life seems jolly [D]rotten, there's [G]somethin' you've for [Em]gotten.
And [Am]that's to laugh and [D]smile and dance and [G]sing.
When you're [Am]feeling in the [D]dumps, [G]don't be silly [Em]chumps.
Just [Am]purse your lips and whistle - that's the [D7]thing.


And [G]always [Em]look on the [Am7]bright  [D7]side of [G]life. [Em][-][Am][-][D]      Come on.
[G]Always [Em]look on the [Am7]light   [D7]side of [G]life. [Em][-][Am][-][D]


For [Am]life is quite ab[D]surd, and [G]death's the final [Em]word.
You must [Am]always face the [D]curtain with a [G]bow.
For [Am]get about your [D]sin, give the [G]audience a [Em]grin.
[Am]Enjoy it it's your last chance any [D7]how.


So [G]always [Em]look on the [Am7]bright  [D7]side of [G]death. [Em][-][Am][-][D]
[G]Just be[Em]fore you [Am7]draw your [D7]terminal [G]breath. [Em][-][Am][-][D]


[Am]Life's a piece of [D]shit, [G]when you look at [Em]it.
[Am]Life's a laugh and [D]death's a joke it's [G]true.
You'll [Am]see it's all a [D]show, keep'em [G]laughing as you [Em]go. 
Just re[Am]member that the last laugh is on [D7]you.


And [G]always [Em]look on the [Am7]bright  [D7]side of [G]life. [Em][-][Am][-][D]
[G]Always [Em]look on the [Am7]right   [D7]side of [G]life. [Em][-][Am][-][D]      (Come on boys, cheer up.)

[A]Always [F#m]look on the [D]right [E7]side of [A]life. [F#m][-][D][-][E]

(Worse things happen at sea, you know.   What are you gonna do, you know,

you come from nothing, you're going back to nothing.   What have you lost?

Nothing!   Nothing will come from nothing, you know what they say?   Cheer

up you old bugger, come on give us a grin, there you are.   See, it's end of the

film.   Incidentally this record is available in the foyer.   Some of us got to live as

well, you know.   They'll dismantle all this in three weeks.   Who pays for this

publicity?   They won't make their money back.   I told them, I said to them, 

Bernie, I said, they'll never make that money back.)
