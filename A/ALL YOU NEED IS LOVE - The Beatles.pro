TIP:  The intro is that bar of trumpet music for Les Marseille.

TIP:  The voicing after "easy" is tricky.  Begin the last syllable of "easy" with a double strums of (D) and (G), then a quick (G) - (G) - (D) and (D)-(Dsus2)-(D) where (Dsus2) is just a quick lifting of the middle finger.  Then move right into the next verse or chorus.

TIP:  In the outro you need two people.  The first sings flat in lower (G) while the other sings in a higher register.  The second person also has the "She loves you" bit that has a (D/A) for the second "yeah" in which you just add your pinky to the 4th string/4th fret.

TIP:  If transposing, play the root chord of the transposed (Gadd) adding the 5th note as necessary.

FUN FACT:  Among the backing singers in the “band” are Mick Jagger and Marianne Faithful, Keith Richards, Jane Asher and Mike McCartney, Maureen Starkey and Patty Harrison, Eric Clapton, Graham Nash, Keith Moon, Hunter Davies, Donovan, and Gary Leeds.
